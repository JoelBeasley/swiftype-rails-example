# Swiftype Integration Demo Application

This is a simple Rails 3 application that publishes changes to a
[Swiftype](http://swiftype.com/) search engine via their API.

Swiftype has a crawler that will index your site, but you may want to
use their API to make sure your content is always up-to-date, if not
all your content is crawlable, or just to have complete control over
what gets indexed.

This application is a companion to
